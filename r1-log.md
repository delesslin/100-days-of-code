# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - DeLesslin

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1
Did JS30 #11 halfway through. Too exhausted to continue.
Also set up project files and updated github profile.

### R1D2
Looked at React, Flux, and React Native with Matt. Discovered using a "wrapper" for p5.js
https://github.com/NeroCor/react-p5-wrapper

### R1D3
Restructured data and fumbled with implementing keypress. Event doesn't seem to have a keyCode associated so I had to add "key" property to data.

### R1D4
Light day. I finally got the keyboard clicks to work.

**Thinking Forward:** I want to watch a flux video and refactor my app to use it

### R1D5
Did some piddle work because I ran out of town: added shift, ctrl, backspace, and space

**Thinking Forward:** I want to watch a flux video and refactor my app to use it

### R1D6
I implemented flux!!! Or some janky version of it. It's such a convenient way to structure the app.

**Thinking Forward:** Implement react and flux in catawbaDictionary
